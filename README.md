# RecipeSetterApp

An android app, intended for use with the recipe setter flask server.

Allows a user to change the recipe on a production line and reports the recipe change to a server.
The recipe list is obtained from the server.
Displays live updates on how many trays have passed since recipe change (info retrieved from the server).
This app does not care which production line it is on; this is handled server-side.
